 # langapp
A simple app in React and Flask that turns finnish pdf's into sentences with translations pulled from Wiktionary REST API for individual words.

In order to work, the app requires standard react libraries and python v3. The React app should be run on localhost 3000 and the app.py file in any python-friendly environment such as Visual Studio. 

If all necessary libraries are present, simply download the repository and run npm start in the conctamanager folder. If that doesn't work, delete node_modules folder and run npm i, then try running npm start again.
