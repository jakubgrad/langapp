 # langapp
A simple app in `React` and `Flask` that turns finnish pdf's into sentences with translations pulled from Wiktionary `REST` `API` for individual words. I created it while taking [Full stack open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course at University of Helsinki. I have since recreated the app in a slightly better looking form in [LangApp23](https://github.com/jakubgrad/LangApp23) and [LangApp23Flask](https://github.com/jakubgrad/LangApp23Flask).

In order to work, the app requires standard `React` libraries and `python` v3. The `React` app should be run on localhost 3000 and the `app.py` file in any python-friendly environment such as `Visual Studio`. 

If all necessary libraries are present, simply download the repository and run npm start in the conctamanager folder. If that doesn't work, delete node_modules folder and run npm i, then try running npm start again.
